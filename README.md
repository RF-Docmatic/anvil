# anvil

CLI tool to quickly setup React application templates.


### Usage 

In order to use this tool, you can either install it on your machine:

```
npm install @rf-docmatic/anvil -g

# And once it's installed:

anvil
```

or use the npm package runner: 

```
npx @rf-docmatic/anvil
```

This will initate the process of generating a new project from a premade template, so you will be asked to enter a name for the new project and select which template to use (default: react-base). 


RECOMMENDED: react-extended

This robust template includes the necessary configuration to start developing a project with the following tools and technologies:
- React
- Typescript
- Ant Design
- redux-toolkit
- redux-observable
- rxjs
- styled-components
- react-dom
